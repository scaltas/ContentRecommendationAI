# Project Requirements

**1. User Management:**
   - **User Registration:** Users can create accounts with unique usernames and passwords.
   - **User Profiles:** Users can set up and edit their profiles, including personal information and preferences.
   - **Authentication and Authorization:** Secure user authentication and role-based authorization to ensure data privacy and system security.

**2. Content Management:**
   - **Content Metadata:** The platform stores metadata for available content, including titles, descriptions, genres, and tags.
   - **Content Upload:** Content administrators can upload new content to the platform and update existing content information.

**3. Real-Time Recommendation Engine:**
   - **AI-Powered Recommendations:** Implement AI algorithms to generate real-time content recommendations based on user behavior, viewing history, and preferences.
   - **Personalization:** Recommendations should be personalized for each user, reflecting their unique interests.
   - **Scalability:** The recommendation engine should scale to handle large volumes of user interactions.

**4. Streaming Analytics:**
   - **User Interaction Tracking:** Capture and analyze user interactions with content in real-time to update recommendations dynamically.
   - **Performance Metrics:** Monitor and report on the effectiveness of recommendation algorithms.

**5. User Interface (Optional):**
   - **User-Friendly Interface:** If applicable, design and develop a user interface (web, mobile, or other) for users to access and interact with the platform.

**6. Load Balancing and Scalability:**
   - **Load Balancing:** Implement load balancing to distribute incoming traffic across microservices for optimal performance.
   - **Auto-Scaling:** Set up auto-scaling to handle increased traffic during peak usage.

**7. Security and Compliance:**
   - **User Data Protection:** Ensure user data security and privacy through encryption and secure data storage.
   - **Compliance:** Comply with relevant data privacy and security regulations, such as GDPR, HIPAA, or industry-specific standards.

**8. Testing and Quality Assurance:**
   - **Test Suites:** Develop comprehensive test suites, including unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests for microservices and AI components.
   - **Continuous Testing:** Implement continuous integration and continuous testing (CI/CT) to automate the testing process.

**9. Documentation:**
   - **API Documentation:** Provide clear and detailed API documentation for developers and users.
   - **Architecture Documentation:** Document the project's architecture, including high-level design and data flow diagrams.
   - **AI Model Documentation:** Explain the AI models used for recommendations, their training data, and performance metrics.

**10. Deployment and Hosting:**
    - **Deployment Strategy:** Plan and execute the deployment of microservices and AI components to a production environment.
    - **Infrastructure Scalability:** Ensure the hosting infrastructure can scale to accommodate growing user numbers.

**11. Monitoring and Logging:**
    - **Monitoring:** Set up monitoring tools to track the performance and health of microservices, AI models, and infrastructure.
    - **Logging:** Implement centralized logging to capture and analyze application logs for troubleshooting and analysis.

**12. User Acceptance Testing (UAT):**
    - **UAT Plan:** Develop a user acceptance testing plan and involve stakeholders to validate that the platform meets their requirements and expectations.

**13. Launch and Maintenance:**
    - **Platform Launch:** Plan and execute the public launch of the platform.
    - **Ongoing Maintenance:** Establish a maintenance plan to address bugs, updates, and enhancements post-launch.

**14. User Support (Optional):**
    - **User Support Channels:** If applicable, define user support channels (e.g., chat support, email support) and guidelines for assisting users.
